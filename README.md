## Summary
In summary, the data supports that a bike sharing company could be viable in Des Monies.  This is based on the data highlighting that many users are subscribers, not casual users which could point to tourist use.  Data also points to a higher ridership from male users.  Two additional visuals that would be benifical would be how far from home do subscribers typically travel, and useage based on weather conditions.
